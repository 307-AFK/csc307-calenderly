# Calenderly

interview scheduling made simple

## What is this for?
Have you ever had to coordinate a bunch of peoples availabilty and then have
people sign up for interviews in those time slots, along with sending them the
necessary event details? Yes, it's a very specific problem, but it's also
something that software is pretty good at handling. That's where Calenderly
comes in. Still a major WIP, but it aims to fix this logistical burden.
